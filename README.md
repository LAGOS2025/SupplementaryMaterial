## ðŸ“„ Abstract  

The Wind Farm Cable Routing Problem (WFCRP) is an NP-hard graph-based optimization problem that models the electrical con- nection of turbines and substations in wind farms. The goal is to transfer energy from the turbines to substations through electrical cables, minimizing the connection cost. Previous works have proposed different approaches for the WFCRP, but a path-relinking metaheuristic does not exist to solve this problem. Because path-relinking has proven suitable for developing hybrid metaheuristics, this paper investigates its application to solve the WFCRP. We implemented six different path-relinking approaches and compared them with state-of-the-art algorithms. Experiments comprised 200 real-world wind farms with different difficulty levels and up to 120 turbines. Statistical tests analyzed solution quality and processing time.

The code directory contains the code that implements the Path Relinking algorithm applied to the problem of cable routing in wind farms. 
This code  only requires toobox to handle graphs and allows a dynamic visualization of the exchange of edges that occurred, as shown in the image Figure.png.
To run the code, simply press F5 in the main.m script. 17 instances were generated to be made available to the reader, however we cannot send the
instances used in the article. To obtain them, it is necessary to request them from D. Cazzaro, M. Fischetti, M. Fischetti.
