## ðŸ“„ Abstract  

The Wind Farm Cable Routing Problem (WFCRP) is an NP-hard graph-based optimization problem that models the electrical con- nection of turbines and substations in wind farms. The goal is to transfer energy from the turbines to substations through electrical cables, minimizing the connection cost. Previous works have proposed different approaches for the WFCRP, but a path-relinking metaheuristic does not exist to solve this problem. Because path-relinking has proven suitable for developing hybrid metaheuristics, this paper investigates its application to solve the WFCRP. We implemented six different path-relinking approaches and compared them with state-of-the-art algorithms. Experiments comprised 200 real-world wind farms with different difficulty levels and up to 120 turbines. Statistical tests analyzed solution quality and processing time.
